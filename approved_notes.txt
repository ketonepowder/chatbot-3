<p>**Chief Complaint:**</p><p>Patient is a 58-year-old male with vision changes noted this morning.</p><p><br></p><p>**History of Present Illness:**</p><p>58-year-old male with a past medical history significant for intracranial hemorrhage x2 in January following a skiing accident, and atrial fibrillation status post ablation yesterday, currently on anticoagulation. The patient presented today with sudden onset of bilateral left hemianopia at approximately 10 AM, which partially resolved within 45 minutes, though slight symptoms persisted at the time of presentation. The patient denies headache, numbness, tingling, weakness, dizziness, neck pain, chest pain, or palpitations. Reports taking last dose of Eliquis at 9:30 AM. History includes a skiing accident on July 31 resulting in an inferior orbital wall fracture and intracranial hemorrhage, managed conservatively with close monitoring and follow-up at a concussion clinic.</p><p><br></p><p>**Review of Systems:**</p><p>- **Neurological:** Denies headache, numbness, tingling, weakness, vision changes beyond the hemianopia, or dizziness.</p><p>- **Cardiovascular:** Denies chest pain or palpitations.</p><p>- **Musculoskeletal:** No new falls or trauma reported; able to ambulate without difficulty.</p><p><br></p><p>**Past Medical History:**</p><p>- Intracranial hemorrhage x2 post-skiing accident</p><p>- Atrial fibrillation, recent ablation</p><p>- Inferior orbital wall fracture</p><p><br></p><p>**Medications:**</p><p>- Eliquis</p><p><br></p><p>**Physical Exam:**</p><p>- **Vitals &amp; Measurements:** Hemodynamically stable, afebrile.</p><p>- **Neurologic:** Nonfocal exam, visual fields intact to confrontation.</p><p>- **Cardiovascular:** EKG without acute ischemic changes.</p><p><br></p><p>**Laboratory and Imaging Results:**</p><p>- **Labs:** Anti-Xa &gt; 1.1, CHL 108, CA 10.6, ALB 5.2, ALP 133, AST 87, TRIG 225, CK 428, Trop 10,000.</p><p>- **CT Head:** No acute intracranial abnormality.</p><p>- **CTA Head and Neck:** No aneurysm, significant stenosis, or acute thrombosis; remote depressed right inferior orbital wall fracture with right maxillary sinus retention cyst noted.</p><p>- **X-ray:** No acute abnormality.</p><p><br></p><p>**Consultations:**</p><p>- **Cardiology:** Recommended TTE; likely related to recent ablation; to be done inpatient.</p><p>- **Neurology:** Recommended MRI brain and echo.</p><p><br></p><p>**Assessment/Plan:**</p><p>1. **Vision Changes with History of Intracranial Hemorrhage:**</p><p>   - Admit for inpatient monitoring due to recent ablation and significant past neurological history.</p><p>   - Perform stat MRI brain and TTE as recommended by neurology and cardiology.</p><p><br></p><p>2. **Atrial Fibrillation Status Post Ablation:**</p><p>   - Continue anticoagulation with monitoring of anti-Xa levels.</p><p>   - Cardiology consultation with inpatient follow-up and TTE to assess for any post-ablation complications.</p><p><br></p><p>3. **Elevated Troponin:**</p><p>   - Concerning for cardiac involvement despite no ischemic changes on EKG; further evaluation with cardiology to rule out myocardial injury.</p><p><br></p><p>4. **General Medical Management:**</p><p>   - Monitor vitals and neurological status closely.</p><p>   - Ensure DVT prophylaxis given the history of anticoagulation and recent ablation.</p><p>   </p><p>**Critical Time:**</p><p>- **PCP: Not listed**</p><p>- **Cardiology: Consulted for inpatient follow-up**</p><p>- **Neurology: Consulted for MRI and echo**</p>
